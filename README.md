# Itaybre-Camera-Controller
Hi everyone,  The CameraController app keeps resetting my Zoom camera settings. Can someone from the development team or community assist me in undoing these adjustments and returning settings to their original state? Details here: CameraController GitHub Issues. Thanks!
